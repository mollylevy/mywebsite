## Welcome to Thunder Basin 

Thunderbasin is both socially and ecologically diverse. Let's integrate science & art 

Here's some data about cars:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
